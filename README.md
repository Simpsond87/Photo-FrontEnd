## Photo-FrontEnd
This project is an assignment for theClubhou.se Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp course.

A boilerplate was used for the foundation of the project for ReactJS. The boilerplate included generators for containers and components.

## Description
This is the Front-End counterpart to the 'Photo-Upload' Back-End project. It allows input of an image file, and displays that image upon clicking the 'submit' button, also alerting a message of success. If the image is not uploaded, there is an alert as well.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run npm install to install all of the necessary libraries. Open your terminal or GitBash and use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Simpsond87/Photo-FrontEnd.git
cd Photo-FrontEnd
npm install
```

To run the server, simply do npm run start and your development website will be on http://localhost:3000.
